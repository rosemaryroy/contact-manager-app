                            Angular- front end development

                            Basic commands
                            1.create new project - ng new project_name
                            2. ng serve
                            3.command to generate component: ng g c component_name
                            4. command to generate service : ng g s service_folder/service_name
                            5.start server ->cmd in server folder npm start
                            6. Angular pipe - ng g p pipe_folder/pipe_name

                            Basic building blocks

                    1. Module - used to include third party libraries
                    2. Components - to create HTML pages includes html,css,ts
                    3. selectors - it replaces HTMl with that components
                    4. angular services- Reusable code that can share btwn components
                    5. Asynchronous function - RXjs
                    6. observable - 
                        subscribe(call back)
                    7. to get http methods 
                    8. Dependency Injection (to share data between two dependant class) (api.service.ts/service) - perform
                        inside constructor
                        syntax :- access specifier variable_name:class_name
                    9. Data binding - data sharing inside a component
                        - one way binding
                         -component (ts) to view (html)
                            - string interpolation - {{variable name}}
                            - property binding - [property]= "property name"
                        -view(html) to components(ts)
                            - event binding - (event_name) = "function_name()"
                            - event binding using $event arguement - (event_name)
                        - two way binding
                            - using ngModel: 
                                - import FormsModule in appModule 
                                - [(ngModel)] = "property_name"
                    10. Directives - DOM manipulation
                            - component Directives
                            - structural Directives - to add/remove html element based on a condition or length of array
                                -*ngif="condition"
                                -*ngfor="let var_name of array_name"
                    11. Pipe - to transform user Input to another format
